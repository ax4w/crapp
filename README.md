# crapp

A friend of mine found [this](https://github.com/tahnok/colmi_r02_client) interesting project
and we decided to get some cheap smart rings of aliexpress. While he is developing an android app I decided to play around
a bit and see how I could read and visualize the data collected by the ring.

Currently the only real rendering is the graph for the heart rate log.
